- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rachelhuaa
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Cognitive Science and Data Science with an emphasis in Cognition. I'm interested in
the intersection of design and tech with a human-centered approach such as UX/UI design! To see my past programming projects and design samples, please
reach out or view my temporary portfolio at: [https://global-vase-fd8.notion.site/Hello-2288ea0989ed42548fec63e6cc52b777]
